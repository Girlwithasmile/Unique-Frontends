# Problem Statement: Math Game

This is also quiz app where you are given some random questions on mathematics with blanks and you need to fill in the blanks to get the proper answer for example 5 * __ = 25 is the question. User has to enter the blank as 5 to get the correct answer. If the answer is wrong then you have to display wrong answer to the user and if it is correct then render a new question.This is how the math game would work.
